These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords. Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools, potentially enables an attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"penetration-testing/Authentication/bypassing-2fa":{"id":"penetration-testing/Authentication/bypassing-2fa","title":"Bypassing 2 Factor Authentication","description":"Bypassing two-factor authentication","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"penetration-testing/Authentication/changing-user-password":{"id":"penetration-testing/Authentication/changing-user-password","title":"Changing user passwords","description":"Changing user passwords","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-based-login-1":{"id":"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-based-login-1","title":"Password based login part-1","description":"Username enumeration","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-based-login-2":{"id":"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-based-login-2","title":"Password based login part-2","description":"Flawed brute-force protection","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-reset-logic":{"id":"penetration-testing/Authentication/password-reset-logic","title":"Password reset logic","description":"A more robust method of resetting passwords is to send a unique URL to users that takes them to a password reset page.
